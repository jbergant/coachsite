### Let go of the narcissist

Today I let go of all the things that do not serve me  
I let go of the desire that things were different         
That we would somehow make it work  
I let go of the desire that you would somehow understand, realize, and see me.


I let go of the desire that the illusion was true.  
I let go of all the hurt I still feel even after our toxic dance.

I accept your limitations and the lack of empathy.  
Now I know your manipulations are your core, and all the sweet was just a trick.

I no longer blame myself for everything that went wrong in our relationship.  
I let go of the confusion when your adoration turned to devaluation and gaslighting.  
I know now it was not all my fault.  
You cannot help yourself, but that does not make it right.

I know there will be no closure and no peace between us.  
The only way to heal is for me to get as far away from you as possible.

It still hurts when I see your face.  
I let go of that pain.

You've projected your fears, your insecurities onto me.  
You've projected all you cannot accept in yourself onto me.  
Now I know that.  
I know that your accusations are only your self-descriptions.

Projections can no longer harm me; they cannot touch me.  
They slide off me and fly back to you.  
Here you go, I let go of all that is not mine, and I'm sending it back.  
It's over; I'm free, letting you go, letting the past go.

I let you go; I let my heart be free.  
No longer fearing your attacks, I no longer give in to your demands.

I know it's never enough for you  
and it's finally enough for me.

Today I stand strong, and I say NO. I say goodbye.  
Goodbye from my heart, goodbye from my focus, and goodbye from my life.




> Note: Do not send this to a narcissist; they would not understand; this goodbye is only for the narcissist victim's heart!
